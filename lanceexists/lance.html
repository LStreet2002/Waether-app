<h1>A Brief Introduction To Coding</h1>  
<h2>What Is Coding And How Often Is It Used?</h2>
 <p>Computer Programming, often referred to as "coding",is the process of building a set of 
     inputs that would cause any device with computing power to perfrom a desired action.
    This refers to devices such as a phone or a computer,which would do nothing without a long series
of code covering every action that can be performed. Not only does coding form the basis of modern technology
but it also can be added to said technology in the form of applications, shortened to "apps". These "apps"
introduce supplementary code to add non factory features. Additonal code must be suitable for the device, which is where
coding languages come in. Each have strenghts and weaknesses, which will be outlined below.</p>

    <td><h3>Hyper Text Markup Language</h3><br/>Used mainly to create the text portion of a website, however has a few 
    decorative options such as tables and headings.Despite displaying mainly text, the 'head' tag contains unseen information
which the domain needs to know in order to load the page correctly. The name of the tab is contained here.The body contains
most text seen by the user.  </td>
    <td><h3>Cascading Style Sheets</h3><br>Used in partnership to create more elaborate visual effects such as <span>
        underlines</span><span2>,font changes</span2> or <span1>shadowing.</span1> As a more in depth decorative tool
     it is often wise to use reset.css in order to have greater flexibility over a website.</td>
        <td><h3>Javascript</h3><br/>Javascript can be described as a 'live' language, in the way that it
        doesn't require a whole page update to make a change. It also works with HTML and CSS, but handles
     mostly hidden aspects of the page. <button type="button"
     onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">
     Click me to display Date and Time.</button><p id="demo"></p> <spanss><br/>This is an example of JavaScript,
      taken from <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp>

        Highly customizable with fine tuning;<br>
        Clearly organised sheets to order prominence of features</td>
    <td><br/>Strengths:<br/>Creates an easier experience for the user;<br>
        Allows for more complex systems to be used in the page;<br/>

    HTML reset needs to be put in place for full effectiveness;</td>
    <td><br>Weaknesses:<br>Not interpreted the same by all browsers;<br/>
    Due to exploitation of client side excecution,many users disable it.</td>

    <spanhi>In the 1940's the first electrical computers were created, and were first instructed by unique code.This 
        meant that most computers had to be programmed separately and couldn't run the same programs.
    This made compatabiliy very difficult, and was extremley hard to write. In the 1950's, the first programming
language was written, named "short code."" Despite solving compatability problems, the machine would have to
translate this code from mathematcal to mechanical. This extra step made the language slow to run. Throughout the 1950's
, a lanuage dubbed "Autocode" was implemented and developed by the university of manchester. This was the first 'compiled'
code, which meant that the language would translate input code into usable code. Despite multiple theoretical 
high-level languages existing, FORTRAN was the first effectively implemented language. It was developed by IBN
, and despite many alterations, many 21st century supercomputers still use it today.It wasn't until 1955 that 
Grace Hopper wrote FLOW-MATIC, the first english programming language to be written, and was implemented in 1958.Throughtout
 the 60's and 70's, many more languages popped up, however some were more crucial than others. For example,
"Speakeasy" was the first language to experiment with Physics in computing, and "Smalltalk" was a completely 
'object' oriented language.As the years progressed, fewer systems were created, and many were combined together 
to form a singular language with multiple functions. The implementation of the internet created a new frontier for 
long standing languages. Many scripting languages became popular during this time, such as Python or JavaScript
because they were very flexible. Since the internet, languages have been simplified allowing them to take to the
mainstream, and form entertainment products rather than professional ones.</spanhi></p>
